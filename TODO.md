* Use divisors when operation is division (no decimal result)
* Handle malformed input
* Report correct answer rate (correct/total * 100)
* Finish as soon as clock reaches 0
* Grab duration from CLI argument
* Train with sin, cos... of known angles, in radians or degrees. Also for well-known operations? (easy log2(x), sqrt, find a/all primitive of a number...)
* All answers with no random operands score equal?
* Pause timer when providing feedback (or produce error sound, then jump to next op)


Done:
* Clock class that implements thread
* Randomize operation
* Read console input (easy)
* Check result (easy)
* Make timer async
* Report remaining time after submitting answer
